**tests/test_bluesky.py:**

*   `test_post_content_with_link`: Tests posting content with a link.
*   `test_post_content_error_handling`: Tests error handling during content posting.
*   `test_get_timeline_default_limit`: Tests getting the timeline with the default limit.
*   `test_get_timeline_with_custom_limit`: Tests getting the timeline with a custom limit.
*   `test_get_post_thread_valid_uri`: Tests getting a post thread with a valid URI.
*   `test_like_post_with_uri_and_cid`: Tests liking a post with URI and CID.
*   `test_like_post_uri_only`: Tests liking a post with URI only.
*   `test_reply_to_post`: Tests replying to a post.
*   `test_get_author_feed_current_user`: Tests getting the author feed for the current user.

**tests/test_twitter.py:**

*   `test_post_content_success`: Tests successful content posting.
*   `test_post_content_error_handling`: Tests error handling during content posting, including retry mechanism.
*   `test_create_new_cookies`: Tests creating new cookies.
*   `test_create_new_cookies_missing_credentials`: Tests creating new cookies with missing credentials.
*   `test_create_new_cookies_auth_failure`: Tests creating new cookies with authentication failure.
*   `test_get_timeline_default_limit`: Tests getting the timeline with the default limit.
*   `test_get_timeline_custom_limit`: Tests getting the timeline with a custom limit.
*   `test_get_tweet_thread`: Tests getting a tweet thread.
*   `test_like_tweet_success`: Tests liking a tweet.
*   `test_reply_to_tweet_success`: Tests replying to a tweet.
*   `test_get_author_feed_specific_user`: Tests getting the author feed for a specific user.
*   `test_setup_auth_existing_cookies`: Tests setting up authentication with existing cookies.
*   `test_retry_mechanism_all_failures`: Tests retry mechanism when all attempts fail.
*   `test_retry_mechanism`: Tests retry mechanism with some failures and a success.

**Comparison:**

The Twitter tests are more comprehensive, covering cookie creation, authentication setup, and retry mechanisms.
Both have tests for posting content, error handling, getting timelines, liking posts/tweets, and replying to posts/tweets.
The Bluesky tests cover posting content with a link, which is not explicitly tested in the Twitter tests.
The Twitter tests include more detailed error handling tests, including retry logic.
The Bluesky tests have a test for getting a post thread, while Twitter has a test for getting a tweet thread.
The Bluesky tests have a test for getting the author feed for the current user, while Twitter has a test for getting the author feed for a specific user.

**Conclusion:**

The `tests/test_twitter.py` file is more complete than `tests/test_bluesky.py`. The Twitter tests include more detailed tests for authentication, cookie handling, and retry mechanisms. The Bluesky tests are missing tests for cookie creation, authentication setup, and retry mechanisms. The Bluesky tests do have a test for posting content with a link, which is not explicitly tested in the Twitter tests.
