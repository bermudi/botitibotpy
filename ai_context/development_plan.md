## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure & Social Media Integration
- `src/__init__.py`: This file initializes the project and defines the version.
- `src/__main__.py`: This file is the main entry point for the CLI application.
- `src/config.py`: This file handles the application's configuration, including environment variables.
- `src/logging_config.py`: This file sets up the application's logging configuration.
- `src/monitoring.py`: This file implements the system monitoring functionality.
- `src/cli/cli.py`: This file implements the command-line interface for the application.
- `src/social/twitter.py`: This file implements the Twitter client.
```
The error occurs in the `get_author_feed` method when trying to deserialize the Twitter API response. The core issue appears to be a mismatch between the expected and actual response format from Twitter's API, specifically around the `ItemContentUnion` type.


Based on the error and documentation, there are a few issues:

1. The Twitter API response format has changed and the library's models are not matching the current response structure. The error shows that the API is returning a `TimelineTile` type, but the library expects one of: `TimelineTweet`, `TimelineTimelineItem`, `TimelineUser`, etc.

2. The error occurs in the deserialization of the `ItemContentUnion` type, which suggests the library needs to be updated to handle the new response format.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. Update the library version - Check if there's a newer version of `twitter_openapi_python` that handles the new response format.

2. Modify the response handling - We could modify the `get_author_feed` method to handle the raw response data instead of relying on the model deserialization.
