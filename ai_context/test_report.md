**Test Report:**

Based on the content of the test files, here's a detailed report on the test coverage:

*   **`tests/test_bluesky.py`**:
    *   Covers posting content with a link, error handling during posting, timeline fetching with default and custom limits, fetching a post thread, liking a post with and without CID, replying to a post, and fetching the author feed.
    *   **Status:** Mostly covers the basic functionalities of the `BlueskyClient`.
*   **`tests/test_twitter.py`**:
    *   Covers successful posting of content, error handling during posting with retry mechanism, cookie creation, timeline fetching with default and custom limits, fetching a tweet thread, liking a tweet, replying to a tweet, fetching the author feed, setting up authentication with existing cookies, and the retry mechanism.
    *   **Status:** Mostly covers the basic functionalities of the `TwitterClient`, including authentication and retry mechanisms.
*   **`tests/test_generator.py`**:
    *   Covers loading content from a source when a new index needs to be created, loading an existing index, and updating the index when content changes.
    *   **Status:** Covers content loading and indexing, but not content generation or customization.
*   **`tests/test_queue_manager.py`**:
    *   Covers task addition, prioritization, concurrency limits, retries, cancellation, status reporting, rate limit handling, and max retries.
    *   **Status:** Thoroughly covers the functionality of the `QueueManager`.
*   **`tests/test_task_scheduler.py`**:
    *   Covers initialization, configuration updates, interval updates, platform-specific configurations, error handling, and the scheduling of content generation, reply checking, and metrics collection tasks. It also tests the stopping of all tasks.
    *   **Status:** Thoroughly covers the functionality of the `TaskScheduler`.
*   **`tests/cli/test_base.py`**: Tests the base CLI framework.
*   **`tests/cli/test_content_commands.py`**: Tests content management commands in the CLI.
*   **`tests/cli/test_social_commands.py`**: Tests social media management commands in the CLI.
*   **`tests/cli/test_system_commands.py`**: Tests system management commands in the CLI.
    *   **Status:** These files cover the basic CLI functionality.

**Completeness Analysis:**

*   **Covered:**
    *   Basic social media integration (Twitter and Bluesky)
    *   Content loading and indexing
    *   Task scheduling and queue management
    *   Basic CLI functionality
*   **Partially Covered:**
    *   Content customization (length, tone, style) - likely partially covered in `test_generator.py` but needs more specific tests.
    *   Content source integration (web page parsing, RSS feed monitoring) - not explicitly tested, likely integrated in `test_generator.py`.
    *   Database operations - no explicit tests for database operations, likely tested implicitly through other tests.
    *   Error recovery - partially covered in `test_twitter.py` and `test_queue_manager.py`, but needs more specific tests for other components.
    *   Logging and monitoring - no explicit tests for logging and monitoring, likely tested implicitly through other tests.
*   **Not Covered:**
    *   Comprehensive logging system
    *   Monitoring and alerting system
    *   API implementation
    *   WebSocket integration
    *   Advanced features (e.g., enhanced error handling, deployment strategy, task priority management, advanced analytics, content optimization, advanced scheduling, advanced monitoring)

**Report Summary:**

The test suite covers the core functionalities of the application, including social media integration, content loading and indexing, task scheduling, queue management, and basic CLI commands. However, there are still gaps in testing for content customization, content source integration, database operations, error recovery, logging, monitoring, and the API implementation. The advanced features are not covered by the current test suite.

The tests for the `TwitterClient`, `BlueskyClient`, `QueueManager`, and `TaskScheduler` are quite comprehensive. The tests for the CLI are basic, and the tests for the `ContentGenerator` are limited to content loading and indexing. There are no explicit tests for the database operations, logging, or monitoring systems.
